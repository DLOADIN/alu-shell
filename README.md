# ALU Shell Project

This repository contains a set of exercises and scripts designed to help understand and practice key concepts related to **shell processes**, **shell signaling**, **bash scripting**, **shell and bash basics**, **permissions**, **loops**, and **parsing**. The project is aimed at enhancing knowledge and proficiency in shell scripting and bash environments.

## Overview

The **ALU Shell Project** covers fundamental and advanced concepts of shell scripting and the bash environment. It includes tasks and challenges that improve understanding of how to manipulate files, control processes, handle signals, and automate tasks using bash scripts. The project aims to provide hands-on experience with:

- **Shell processes and signaling**: Learn how to control processes, send signals, and handle interruptions.
- **Bash scripting**: Write scripts to automate tasks, manage system resources, and handle user inputs.
- **Permissions and file management**: Work with file and directory permissions to control access and usage.
- **Loops and parsing**: Implement loops, conditionals, and parsing techniques to manage repetitive tasks and handle data input.

## Features

1. **Shell Processes and Signaling**:
   - Understanding and managing processes in the shell.
   - Sending and receiving signals to control process execution.
   - Handling process interruptions and background jobs.

2. **Bash Scripting**:
   - Writing bash scripts to automate routine tasks.
   - Script debugging and error handling.
   - Managing user inputs and arguments passed into scripts.

3. **Shell and Bash Basics**:
   - Basic shell commands and navigation.
   - Introduction to the bash environment, bash built-ins, and command-line utilities.

4. **Permissions**:
   - Understanding file and directory permissions.
   - Changing permissions using `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp`.
   - Managing ownership and group permissions.

5. **Loops and Parsing**:
   - Using `for`, `while`, and `until` loops for repetitive tasks.
   - Parsing text and handling files line by line.
   - Practical use cases of conditionals and loops in bash scripts.

## Technologies

This project is based on:
- **Bash**: The Bourne Again Shell, a command-line interpreter for Unix/Linux systems.
- **Shell**: Command-line interface for interaction with the operating system.
- **Unix/Linux**: The underlying system environment where shell processes are managed.
